# ReactJS Docker Demo

I built this app while going through Stephen Grider's [Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/) course.

The purpose of building this app was to become more comfortable with Docker, GitHub Actions, and deploying to AWS.
